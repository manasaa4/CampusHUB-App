📖 About
CampusHUB is a comprehensive, web-based management system built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It is designed to streamline academic operations, enhance communication, and provide a centralized platform for administrators, teachers, and students.

✨ Features
User Roles: The system supports three distinct user roles: Admin, Teacher, and Student, each with tailored dashboards and permissions.

Admin Dashboard: Administrators (like the Head of Department) can manage the entire system, including:

Adding new students and faculty members.

Creating and organizing classes and subjects.

Managing user accounts and system settings.

Attendance Tracking: Teachers can efficiently take class attendance, mark students as present or absent, and generate detailed attendance reports.

Performance Assessment: Teachers can input student marks and provide constructive feedback on their performance. Students can access their marks and track their academic progress over time.

Data Visualization: Students can view their performance data through interactive charts and tables, helping them easily understand their academic standing.

Seamless Communication: The platform includes built-in messaging features, allowing students, teachers, and admins to communicate effectively and promote collaboration.
